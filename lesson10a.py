# Error Handling/Exception Handling....
# Handling errors created by the users to avoid system from crashing
# we use try, except block
# try: houses a code that might generate an error from the user
# except/catch: where the error is handled before system crashing

# while True:
#     try:
#         number = int(input(" Enter a digit?: "))
#         print(f" You have entred {number} ")

#     except:
#         print("Please enter a valid input...")

num1 = int(input(" Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter Second Number: "))

division = num1/num2
print(division)
